- To run this program just run the following command "python main.py source replica 30 log.txt" 'source' is the folder where we will 
get the files and then redirect them to the 'replica' folder where everything will be stored, '30' is the time in seconds to sync the 
folders and 'log.txt' is the txt file where all the changes made will be stored;

- This program runs internally inside the 'test_python_sync' folder, thus encompassing the 'source' and 'replica' folders;
